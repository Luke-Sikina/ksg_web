The Knowledge Systems Group (KSG) at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute seeks a **Bioinformatics Engineer to help build a new open-source software to enable precision cancer medicine**. 

The Bioinformatics Engineer is an exceptional candidate who has both bioinformatics experience and extensive software engineering experience. We operate at the crossroads of cancer genomics and software, and are looking for that rare individual who has experience and passion for both. Our platforms are focused on mining of cancer genomic data sets, matching patients to clinical trials, and building cloud-based infrastructure for sharing of immunologic data.

## Responsibilities

* Design and develop software, databases and interfaces for analyzing and manipulating genomic and immunologic data, and matching patients to clinical trials.
* Design and develop Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), microservices, and asynchronous queuing systems.
* Orchestrate cloud-based services via modern devops frameworks.
* Develop new Python software modules, developed via best practices, including unit testing, automated build processes and code reviews.
* Design and develop cloud-based bioinformatic workflows, e.g. for whole exome sequencing and RNASeq data.
* Implement bioinformatic workflows using workflow specification languages, e.g. WDL / CWL / Snakemake.
Work independently, and with external experts, to understand novel biological data types and help the software team with the implementation of them in our projects.


## Qualifications

* Bachelor's or Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology or a related field.
* 2+ years of software engineering experience in the bioinformatics or cancer genomics space.
* Expert knowledge of Python.
* Expert knowledge of relational and non-relational databases, especially MongoDB.
* Strong interest in contributing to biological research with clinical applications.
* Experience in modern software development technologies, including distributed versioning systems, * continuous integration, and Agile programming practices.

The candidate must demonstrate excellent communication skills, outstanding personal initiative and the ability to work effectively as part of a team. Ability to meet deadlines and efficiently multitask is a must.

## Desirable skills: 

Any of the following would be significant plusses:  Experienced knowledge of Javascript and any modern Javascript library, especially React.  Cloud computing experience, e.g. Amazon, Google Compute, or Digital Ocean.  Any cloud devop framework experience, such as Kubernetes.  User interaction design and data visualization. Experience with bioinformatics workflow software such as WDL / CWL and Snakemake.
